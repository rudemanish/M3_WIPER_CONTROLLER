# INTRODUCTION

The automotive industry has spent the last two decades vigorously researching ways to use modern computing and electronic improvements in the development of vehicle safety, dependability, and entertainment technology. With a growing number of distractions, automated rain-sensing wiper systems become an even more tempting feature, as they attempt to reduce the amount of time the driver has take his or her hands off the wheel. Most classic systems can operate at both intermittent and variable speeds. The typical wiper system, on the other hand, necessitates constant driver attention when altering the wiper speed. Traditional windshield wiper speed changes with the passage of time and the speed of the vehicle. Because manual wiper adjustment diverts the driver's attention, it may be a direct cause of accidents.

# OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT

Windshield wipers may be a little component of your vehicle, but they have a significant impact on your driving and overall safety.
At the touch of a button, they remove rain, snow, dirt, pollen, frost, and other debris fast and smoothly!
The wiper arms are moved across the windshield by the windshield wiper motor. The metal or hard plastic arms pull a thin rubber (or silicone) blade over the windshield to clean water from the lens, allowing you to see the road better.
Wiper blades break, rip, and lose their flexibility and functionality with time. Wipers are harmed by a variety of factors, including road grit, bird droppings, severe temperatures, and UV light.
