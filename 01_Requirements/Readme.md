# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:

STM32 CubeIDE

# COMPONENTS:

STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD

# DESCRIPTION:

The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family depends on the elite execution Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-digit RISC center working at a recurrence of up to 168 MHz. The Cortex-M4 center highlights a Floating point unit (FPU) single accuracy which upholds all Arm single-accuracy information handling guidelines and information types. It likewise carries out a full arrangement of DSP guidelines and a memory insurance unit (MPU) which improves application security. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family consolidates rapid implanted

# Xpack Packages:

Windows Build Tools: The xPack Windows Build Tools is a standalone Windows binary distribution of GNU make and a few of other tools required by the Eclipse Embedded CDT (formerly GNU MCU/ARM Eclipse) project, but the binaries can also be used in generic build environments.
