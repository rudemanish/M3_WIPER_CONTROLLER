# Abstract

The wiper speed control framework controls the operating speed of the wiper according to the downpour. Remove raindrops and other liquids from the windshield of the vehicle. In previous frames, the wiper had to be operated manually, which made it difficult to raise the wiper. Next, this strategy is proposed to solve this problem. This task has the potential to accelerate the evolution of automotive frameworks by providing robotized transmissions. Most of the vehicles have two wipers. One is in the rear window and the other is in the front window. The wiper parts found on vehicles are the elastic sharp edges, the wiper arm that holds the cutting edge, the spring linkage, and  the wiper coil parts. Caution Gears can generate the force expected to move the wiper when needed. Today, we use a computer-controlled wiper system at any point  in the middle of the cycle, resulting in a home position. This is the new wiper system behind the wiper arm. The guidelines for this proposed wiper frame are substantially the same as those for other existing traditional wipers.

# Features

1. It will lock the vehicle when the button is squeezed once

2. It will open the vehicle when the button is squeezed two times.

3. It will wiper on and it moves clock wise bearing and when the button is squeezed threefold

4. It will wiper off and it moves hostile to clock wise heading and when the button is squeezed multiple times

5. It will wiper complete one cycle when the button is squeezed multiple times.
