# Abstract

The wiper speed control framework controls the operating speed of the wiper according to the downpour. Remove raindrops and other liquids from the windshield of the vehicle. In previous frames, the wiper had to be operated manually, which made it difficult to raise the wiper. Next, this strategy is proposed to solve this problem. This task has the potential to accelerate the evolution of automotive frameworks by providing robotized transmissions. Most of the vehicles have two wipers. One is in the rear window and the other is in the front window. The wiper parts found on vehicles are the elastic sharp edges, the wiper arm that holds the cutting edge, the spring linkage, and  the wiper coil parts. Caution Gears can generate the force expected to move the wiper when needed. Today, we use a computer-controlled wiper system at any point  in the middle of the cycle, resulting in a home position. This is the new wiper system behind the wiper arm. The guidelines for this proposed wiper frame are substantially the same as those for other existing traditional wipers.

# Brief Introduction

The car industry has been intensively researching ways to harness modern computing and electronic developments in the development of safety, dependability, and entertainment technologies for the past two decades. Despite this, for a variety of reasons, automatic rain-sensing wiper systems are rather uncommon in modern vehicles. In new cars, they are frequently too pricey, unattractive, or unreliable to be desirable. Many attempts have been made to develop an effective, dependable, and inexpensive rain detection and wiper control system that adjusts the vehicle's speed and intermittent interval automatically based on the amount of rain. Optical sensors are commonly used to monitor the amount of water.

The fact that the refraction angle and amount of light reflection varies when the two windshields are moist is used in this sort of sensor. Despite their widespread use, optical sensors have several drawbacks. The sensitivity to external light is one of the drawbacks. Another issue arises when driving at night, via tunnels, or even in underground parking. Many systems still engage the wiper as the automobile exits tunnels or underground parking lots for this reason. Another flaw, possibly the most serious, is that the sensing area is a small piece of the windshield. As a result, the system can only operate in a small region.

The wiper system may fail to activate when there are some raindrops on the driverâ€™s line of sight, but not on the sensing area. They are often too expensive, too unsightly, or too unreliable to be desired in new automobiles.

# Features

1. It will lock the vehicle when the button is squeezed once
